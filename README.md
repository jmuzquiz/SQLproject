# Introduction
ðŸ“Š Welcome to an exploration of the data job market! This project delves into the realm of data scientist roles, uncovering ðŸ’° top-paying jobs, ðŸ”¥ in-demand skills, and ðŸ“ˆ intersections where high demand meets high salary in the field of data science.

ðŸ”Ž Curious about the SQL queries used? Check them out [here](project_sql_queries/)

# Background

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis originates from a comprehensive [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql), featuring rich insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Job listings were gathered throughout 2023 using a specialized [app](https://datanerd.tech) developed by the course leader. The dataset is hosted externally on Google Drive. You can access it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1moeWYoUtUklJO6NJdWo9OV8zWjRn0rjN).

Additionally, CSV files generated from SQL queries that were used for data visualizations can be found [here](sql_query_csv_results/). Visualizations were created using ggplot2 in RStudio. The R script file containing the code for SQL query 1 and 2 visualizations can be found [here](R_scripts/R_visualizations.R).

## Project Overview

Driven by a desire to better understand the data scientist job market and identify the most lucrative and sought-after skills, this project aimed to streamline the job search process for others seeking optimal positions in the data science field. Additionally, this project provided a valuable opportunity for me to become proficient in SQL and demonstrate my capability to perform advanced queries.

## Objectives
Throughout this project, I sought answers to the following key questions through SQL queries:

1. What are the top-paying data scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data scientists?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my exploration of the data scientist job market, I utilized:

- **SQL:** Essential for querying and analyzing the dataset, providing insights into data scientist job trends.
- **PostgreSQL:** Chosen for its robust database management capabilities, ideal for handling and analyzing job postings data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Used for writing and executing SQL queries, providing a user-friendly environment for project management.
- **Git and GitHub:** Employed for version control and potential collaboration, enabling future sharing of SQL scripts and analysis with others.
- **R:** Utilized for data visualization to create insightful graphics based on the queried data.
- **RStudio:** Served as the integrated development environment for writing and running R scripts, facilitating data visualization.

This project marked my first experience with SQL, PostgreSQL, Visual Studio Code, and Git/GitHub, allowing me to gain valuable skills in database management, SQL querying, version control, and preparing for potential collaboration on GitHub. While I have prior experience with R and RStudio, I further refined my ability to visualize data by exporting SQL query results as CSVs and creating visualizations in RStudio.

# Analysis of Remote Data Scientist Positions
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data scientist job market, with a particular focus on remote positions. Here's how I approached each question:

## 1. Top-Paying Remote Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data scientist positions by average yearly salary and location, with a focus on remote roles. This query highlights lucrative career options within the field of data science.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### Key Findings

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying remote data scientist roles span from $300,000 to $550,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like Walmart, Reddit, and Selby Jennings are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Scientist to Director of Data Science & Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data science.

### Visualizing Top Salaries

To visualize the top 10 highest paying remote data scientist jobs based on average yearly salary, I used the following R code. The [CSV file](sql_query_csv_results/top_salaries_data_scientist.csv) used contains the results from the first SQL query:

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(readr) # For reading CSV file
library(scales) # For formatting

# Read the CSV file
data <- read_csv("top_salaries_data_scientist.csv")  # Replace with your location of the file

# Ensure salary_year_avg is numeric
data$salary_year_avg <- as.numeric(data$salary_year_avg)

# Take top 10 salaries
top_10 <- head(data, 10)

# Truncate job titles to make them shorter
top_10$job_title <- substr(top_10$job_title, 1, 23)

# Create a horizontal bar plot with formatted salary labels
ggplot(top_10, aes(x = salary_year_avg, y = reorder(job_title, -salary_year_avg))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Highest Paying Data Scientist Jobs",
       x = "Average Yearly Salary",
       y = "Job Title") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format(prefix = "$", suffix = "k", scale = 1e-3)) +  # Format salary labels
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```
The resulting bar graph from the above R code is shown below:

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Remote Data Scientist Jobs
To understand the skills required for the top-paying remote data scientist jobs, I integrated job postings data with skills data. Each job-skill combination was captured, offering insights into the specific skills employers prioritize for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills --from skills_dim table
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
### Key Findings:

### Visualizing Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To visualize the count of skills for the top 10 highest paying remote data scientist jobs, I used the following R code. The [CSV file](sql_query_csv_results/top_paying_job_skills_data_scientist.csv) used contains the results from the second SQL query:

```r
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Read the CSV file
skills_data <- read.csv("top_paying_job_skills_data_scientist.csv")

# Count the frequency of each skill
skill_counts <- table(skills_data$skill)
skill_counts <- as.data.frame(skill_counts)
colnames(skill_counts) <- c("skill", "count")

# Create a bar plot for skill counts with reversed order and gradient color
ggplot(skill_counts, aes(x = reorder(skill, count), y = count, fill = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip coordinates to make it horizontal
  labs(title = "Skill Count for Top 10 Highest Paying Data Scientist Jobs",
       x = "Skill",
       y = "Frequency") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "blue") +  # Gradient color
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Hide the legend
```
The resulting bar graph from the above R code is shown below:
