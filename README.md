# Background

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of information on the top 10 highest paying data scientist jobs based on average yearly salary. You can access the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/your_folder_id).

Please note that the dataset is hosted externally on Google Drive and is not stored within this GitHub repository.*


Driven by a desire to better understand the data scientist job market and identify the most lucrative and sought-after skills, this project aimed to streamline the job search process for others seeking optimal positions in the data science field. Additionally, this project provided a valuable opportunity for me to become proficient in SQL and demonstrate my capability to perform advanced queries.

The dataset used for this analysis originated from a [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql), containing valuable insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. The data included job listings collected throughout the year 2023 using an [app](https://datanerd.tech) developed by the course leader.

### The questions I aimed to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data scientists?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

By addressing these questions, the project provided a comprehensive overview of the current data science job market, highlighting key areas for professional development and career advancement. At the same time, it showcased my proficiency in SQL and my ability to handle complex data queries.

# Tools I Used
For my exploration of the data scientist job market, I utilized:

- **SQL:** Essential for querying and analyzing the dataset, providing insights into data scientist job trends.
- **PostgreSQL:** Chosen for its robust database management capabilities, ideal for handling and analyzing job postings data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Used for writing and executing SQL queries, providing a user-friendly environment for project management.
- **Git and GitHub:** Employed for version control and potential collaboration, enabling future sharing of SQL scripts and analysis with others.

This project marked my first experience with these tools, allowing me to gain valuable skills in database management, SQL querying, version control, and preparing for potential collaboration on GitHub.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data scientist job market. Here's how I approached each question:

## 1. Top-Paying Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data scientist positions by average yearly salary and location, with a focus on remote opportunities. This query highlights lucrative career options within the field of data science.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data scientist jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data scientist roles span from $300,000 to $550,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like Walmart, Reddit, and Selby Jennings are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Scientist to Director of Data Science & Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data science.

### Visualizing Top Salaries

Here is an example of R code that can be used to visualize the top 10 highest paying data scientist jobs based on average yearly salary, as identified from the 1st analysis query. 
```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(readr) # For reading CSV file
library(scales) # For formatting

# Read the CSV file
data <- read_csv("top_salaries_data_scientist.csv")  # Replace with your location of the file

# Ensure salary_year_avg is numeric
data$salary_year_avg <- as.numeric(data$salary_year_avg)

# Take top 10 salaries
top_10 <- head(data, 10)

# Truncate job titles to make them shorter
top_10$job_title <- substr(top_10$job_title, 1, 23)

# Create a horizontal bar plot with formatted salary labels
ggplot(top_10, aes(x = salary_year_avg, y = reorder(job_title, -salary_year_avg))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Highest Paying Data Scientist Jobs",
       x = "Average Yearly Salary",
       y = "Job Title") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format(prefix = "$", suffix = "k", scale = 1e-3)) +  # Format salary labels
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```
Here is the bar graph that results from the above R code: (said here too many times!!!!!) (should i say above???)*

**The file path in the R code should be replaced with your actual path to the CSV file containing the top salaries data. The top salaries CSV file containing the results from the 1st analysis SQL query can be found here: [assets folder](/assets/)*
*edit to the appropriate folder later after adding the csv file to it (a data folder within SQLProject), the current one just houses the image!!

yo i have edits pls let me edit



### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills --from skills_dim table
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    -- AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
Here's a breakdown of the results for the top paying skills for Data Analysts:
-**High Demand for Big Data & ML Skills:** Top salaries are commanded by analysts skilled in big data technologies (PySpark, Couchbase), machine learning tools (DataRobot, Jupyter), and Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy), reflecting the industry's high valuation of data processing and predictive modeling capabilites.
